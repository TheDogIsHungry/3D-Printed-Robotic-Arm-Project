This project served as a basic introduction to the building and control of a 3D-Printed arm using servo motors to move. The arm was assembled and originally coded to accept a modified version of the included Android app, which was later switched to basic loop control. Via Arduino IDE the Servo library allows for extremely easy servo control, which made moving the robot quite easy. Switching over to loop control was easy and made more sense for the competition in class. Overall we applied our knowledge of inverse and forward kinematics towards this robot, allowing us to work with a real work application of what we are learning in class.
