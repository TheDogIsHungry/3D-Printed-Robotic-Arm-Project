This project served as a basic introduction to the building and control of a 3D-printed arm using servo motors. The arm was assembled and originally coded to accept a modified version of the included Android app, which was later switched to basic loop control. The Arduino IDE servo library allows for extremely easy servo control, which made moving the robot quite easy. The final version of the code runs through a simple loop that picks up a ducky and turns around to place said ducky into a box.
